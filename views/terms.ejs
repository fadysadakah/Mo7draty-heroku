            suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any
            provision
            of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete
            your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your email
            address
            and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.</p>
